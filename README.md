Creating a new repo on github
This is my first step in learning how to use github. 
To create a repo, simply click on the + icon on the right top navbar on your git hub page
Type in a titie/name for your repository and initialize the readMe  option
then comit/save.
You can now edit your README.md to list out your comments , like I did here then of course, dont forget to commmit changes.
I am epected to submit the url of my repo as a task.
Happy I have learnt to do this and though it seems easy
I know there's more to learn about using Github.
Thank you for this opportunity to learn.
